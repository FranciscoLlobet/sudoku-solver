1. **Introduction and Goals**
    - Provide a C++ implementation of a Sudoku puzzle solver
    - Implement a SudokuPuzzle class with methods for creating, initializing, printing, and solving Sudoku puzzles
    - Use a recursive pruning and backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzles

2. **Constraints**
    - Must be implemented in C++
    - Must use the private C-Library `_sudoku.h`
    - Must handle standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles

3. **Context and Scope**
    - The Sudoku Solver can be integrated into applications that require solving Sudoku puzzles
    - It operates as a standalone C++ library and does not interact with any external systems

4. **Solution Strategy**
    - Implement a SudokuPuzzle class with methods for creating, initializing, printing, and solving puzzles
    - Use a recursive pruning and backtracking algorithm for solving puzzles
    - Provide utility functions for tracking recursion level and solve calls

5. **Building Block View**
    - `SudokuPuzzle` class:
        - Constructors and destructor
        - Assignment operator
        - Puzzle initialization methods
        - Print method
        - GetPuzzle method
        - Set and get value methods
        - Solve method
    - Utility functions:
        - GetMaxLevel
        - GetSolveCalls
        - ResetMaxLevel
        - ResetSolveCalls

6. **Runtime View**
    - Create a SudokuPuzzle object and initialize it with a puzzle string or an empty puzzle
    - Set values in the puzzle using the SetValue method
    - Solve the puzzle using the Solve method
    - Retrieve the solved puzzle as a string using the GetPuzzle method
    - Print the puzzle using the Print method

7. **Deployment View**
    - The Sudoku Solver is a C++ library that can be compiled and linked into any application that requires solving Sudoku puzzles

8. **Cross-cutting Concepts**
    - Error handling: The library uses result codes (Sudoku_RC_T) to indicate success or failure of various operations
    - Memory management: The library uses dynamic memory allocation for the SudokuPuzzle objects and proper cleanup in the destructor

9. **Design Decisions**
    - Use of the private C-Library `_sudoku.h` for lower-level puzzle manipulation
    - Implement the recursive pruning and backtracking algorithm for solving puzzles

10. **Quality Scenarios**
    - Performance: The solver should be able to solve most puzzles within a reasonable time
    - Robustness: The solver should handle invalid puzzles and provide appropriate error codes

11. **Risks and Technical Debt**
    - The solver may struggle with extremely difficult puzzles or take a long time to solve them due to the recursive nature of the algorithm
    - The library currently supports only 9x9 puzzles; extending it to other sizes would require modifications

12. **Glossary**
    - SudokuPuzzle: A class representing a Sudoku puzzle with methods for initialization, solving, and manipulation
    - Pruning: The process of eliminating impossible values in the puzzle based on the Sudoku rules
    - Backtracking: A problem-solving algorithm that tries out different possible solutions and "backtracks" when a solution does not work
